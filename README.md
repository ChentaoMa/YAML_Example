This guide will help you set up scheduled e2e (end-to-end) testing for a website hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We'll use Google Cloud Functions and Google Cloud Scheduler to automate this process.

## Step 1: Prepare Test Code and Repository

Make sure your e2e testing code is stored in a GitHub repository and that you've configured scripts to run these tests. Your testing scripts should use tools like Playwright to execute end-to-end tests for your website.

## Step 2: Create a Cloud Function `https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/deploy`

```
Option:
Deploy from:
[1] local machine
[2] Cloud Storage
[3] source repository
```
1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Functions.
2. Click "Create Function."

   a. Give your function a name.
   
   b. Choose a runtime. You can select Node.js, Python, or another supported runtime.

   c. In the trigger type, select "HTTP."
   
   d. In the `index.js` file, write the code for your Cloud Function. This code will trigger your tests. Here's an example Node.js Cloud Function code snippet that calls your testing script:

   ```javascript
   const child_process = require('child_process');
   
   exports.runE2ETests = (req, res) => {
     // Execute your testing script here
     const testProcess = child_process.spawn('your-e2e-test-command', ['--args']);
   
     testProcess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
       console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
     });
   
     testProcess.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
       console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
     });
   
     testProcess.on('close', (code) => {
       console.log(`Tests completed, exit code: ${code}`);
     });
   
     res.status(200).send('e2e tests initiated.');
   };


   e. Deploy it as a Cloud Function.

## Step 3: Set Up a Cloud Scheduler Job `https://cloud.google.com/scheduler/docs/overview`

1. In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to Cloud Scheduler.
2. Click "Create Job."

   a. Provide a name for the job.
   
   b. In "Target," select "HTTP."
   
   c. In "URL," enter the HTTP trigger URL of your Cloud Function.
   
   d. Choose the request type as "GET."
   
   e. Provide a description of the job.
   
   f. In "Time zone," select the appropriate time zone.
   
   g. In "Schedule," specify when you want the tests to run, e.g., "0 * * * *" for running every hour.

   h. Click "Create."

## Step 4: Set Up Google Calendar Reminder

1. Open Google Calendar.

2. Create a new event or reminder for scheduling your tests. In the event's notification settings, add a notification method.

3. In the notification settings, choose "Browser" and paste the URL of the Cloud Scheduler job. This ensures that the Cloud Scheduler job will be invoked when the event triggers.

## Step 5: Deployment and Testing

Deploy the Cloud Function and Cloud Scheduler job, ensuring they run your e2e tests according to the schedule. Additionally, ensure that your testing script can execute the tests and record the results. For cases of test failures or issues, make sure to log error information for timely identification and resolution.

These steps will allow you to run e2e tests on a predefined schedule and receive reminders through Google Calendar. Further configuration and customization may be required based on your specific needs and environment.
